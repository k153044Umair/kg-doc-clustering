Australia's terms of trade also fell, by 18 pct, over the past two years, he told Parliament. Terms of trade are the difference between import and export price indexes. Despite the figures, the budget forecast of about 1.75 pct annual growth in employment would be met, Keating said. Unemployment is currently at 8.2 pct of the workforce. "This government is dragging Australia through a trading holocaust the kind of which we have not seen since the Second World War," Keating said. "We are not pushing this place into a recession. We are not only holding our gains on unemployment, we are bringing unemployment down," he said, adding that the government had help the country avoid recession. REUTER
